### ðŸ‘‹Hello. I am Gerardo

ðŸ’»I am a logical and results-driven full stack developer. Certified in both Front-End and Back-end technologies after successfully completed a 700 h bootcamp course. Passionate about developing web applications and working across the full stack using F/E and B/E technologies such as React, Redux, CSS, Note js, Express and Sequelize and specialized in PostgreSQL for database development. Looking forward to applying my knowledge and skills in a challenging role.

ðŸ“šIâ€™m a curious and self-starter person, so I found in the Industrial Engineering the perfect study course to develop my passion because of the broad academic curriculum it offers. This great variety of courses has helped me develop my analytical and problem-solving skills.
And it is thanks to this broad academic curriculum that I studied programming for the first time and I became passionate about it. Iâ€™m eager to apply my acquired knowledge to solve problems using technology and also to learn and develop my skills within the IT area.

ðŸ—£ I have experience in customer services and sales which has helped me devolop my communication skills. I am able to identify customer needs, advise them on the best solutions and deliver superior service from the start to end. Also, working in Customer Services has developed my adaptability skills. I can thrive on challenges and excel in new environments.

Thank you for your visit
