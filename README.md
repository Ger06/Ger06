### ðŸ‘‹Hello. I am Gerardo

### About me
ðŸ‘· I am a Full Stack Developer with professional experience. Over the past three years, I have worked on various projects and teams, where I have applied my knowledge and analytical skills.

### Technologies 
ðŸ’» I am a logical and results-driven full stack developer. Certified in both Front-End and Back-end technologies after successfully completed a 700 h bootcamp course. Passionate about developing web applications and working across the full stack using F/E and B/E technologies such as React, Redux, CSS, Node js, Next js, Express, Mongo DB and PostgreSQL for database development. Looking forward to applying my knowledge and skills in a challenging role.

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m a curious and self-starter person, so I found in the Industrial Engineering the perfect study course to develop my passion because of the broad academic curriculum it offers. This great variety of courses has helped me develop my analytical and problem-solving skills.
Iâ€™m eager to apply my acquired knowledge to solve problems using technology and also to learn and develop my skills within the IT area.
